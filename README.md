**Overview**:
This website creates a flash card to users when they submit their details like Input fields to present Username, Mail ID, Department, Project Links, and Description data, Option to upload a profile image into it. 

**Additional Feautures**:
  1. User profile information displayed on a personal profile page.
  2. Switch to Darkmode(DarkGreen) and Lightmode(LightGreen)
  3. Animated Background to Enhance User Experience
  4. Output is shown as a FlashCard that shows up the details with a "Smooth Transition" when user hovers over it with their mouse.
  5. Finally, I Love to work with Team "ACE" so I've added a "Footer" which shows my eagerness to be in the Association and reach greater heights.
